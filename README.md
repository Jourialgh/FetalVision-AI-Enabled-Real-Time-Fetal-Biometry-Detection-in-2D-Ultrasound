# FetalVision-AI-Enabled-Real-Time-Fetal-Biometry-and-Abnormality-Detection-in-2D-Ultrasound
FetalVision is a project aimed at leveraging deep learning models for real-time fetal biometry estimation and abnormality detection using 2D ultrasound images. This repository contains implementations of two deep learning models: U-Net and FCN, trained on a custom dataset for this specific task.
